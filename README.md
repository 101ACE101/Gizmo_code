# Gizmo_code
Code created for Gizmo project:
Our setup uses one servo motor, one stepper motor and a capacitive touch sensor.  When the wire connected to pin 12 is touched the stepper motor rotates 360 degrees.  When the wire connected to pin 0 is touched the servo motor rotates 90 degrees and back.
